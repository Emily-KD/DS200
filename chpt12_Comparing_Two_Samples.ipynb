Since the treatment and control groups are assigned randomly in such experiements, differences in their outcomes can be compared to what would happen just due to chance if the treatment had no effect at all. If the observed differences are more marked than what we would predict as purely due to chance, we will have evidence of *causation*.

        "## Treating Chronic Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial\n",
        "Low-back pain in adults can be very persistent and hard to treat. Common methods run the gamut from corticosteroids to acupuncture. A [randomized controlled trial (RCT)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11376175) examined the effect of using Botulinum Toxin A (BTA) as a treatment. Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxic protein that causes the disease botulism; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin) says that botulinum \"is the most acutely lethal toxin known.\" There are seven types of botulinum toxin. Botulinum Toxin A is one of the types that can cause disease in humans, but it is also used in medicine to treat various diseases involving the muscles. The RCT analyzed by Foster, Clapp, and Jabbari in 2001 examined it as a treatment for low back pain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thirty one patients with low-back pain were randomized into treatment and control groups, with 15 in the treatment group and 16 in control. The control group was given normal saline, and the trials were run double-blind so that neither doctors nor patients knew which group they were in.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eight weeks after the start of the study, nine of the 15 in the treatment group and two of the 16 in the control group had pain relief (according to a precise definition used by the researchers). These data are in the table `bta` and appear to show that the treatment has a clear benefit."

In terms of the table `observed_outcomes`, the question is whether the distribution of the 31 \"treatment\" values in Column 1  (including the unknown ones) is different from the distribution of the 31 \"control\" values in Column 2 (again including the unknown ones).\n",

        "**Null Hypothesis:** The distribution of all 31 potential \"treatment\" outcomes is the same as that of all 31 potential \"control\" outcomes. Botulinum toxin A does nothing different from saline; the difference in the two samples is just due to chance.\n",

        "Notice that the alternative is not specifying that the treatment helps – just that it is different from the control. This is standard in medical studies because it doesn't pre-judge which way the result might go. But you are welcome to run a test for whether the treatment does better than the control. Just adjust your test statistic accordingly.\n",

If the null hypothesis were true, it wouldn't matter which of those 31 outcomes were labeled \"treatment\" and which \"control.\" Any random subset of 16 out of the 31 values could be called \"control\" and the remaining 15 \"treatment\".\n",
        "\n",
        "We can simulate this. We can randomly permute the 31 values, split them into two groups of 16 and 15, and see how different the distributions in the two groups are. Since the data are zeros and ones, we can just see how different the two proportions are. \n",
        "\n",
        "That's exactly what we did for A/B testing in the previous section. Sample A is now the control group and Sample B the treatment group. We will carry out the test below showing the details of all the steps. You should confirm that they are the same as the steps carried out for A/B testing.\n",

So our test statistic will be the distance between the two group proportions, that is, the absolute value of the difference between them.\n",

The meta-analysis gave it the highest assessment among all the studies (LBP stands for low-back pain): \"We identified three studies that investigated the merits of BoNT for LBP, but only one had a low risk of bias and evaluated patients with non-specific LBP (N = 31).\" \n",

        "Putting it all together, the meta-analysis concluded, \"There is low quality evidence that BoNT injections improved pain, function, or both better than saline injections and very low quality evidence that they were better than acupuncture or steroid injections. ...  Further research is very likely to have an important impact on the estimate of effect and our confidence in it.

        "On January 18, 2015, the Indianapolis Colts and the New England Patriots played the American Football Conference (AFC) championship game to determine which of those teams would play in the Super Bowl. After the game, there were allegations that the Patriots' footballs had not been inflated as much as the regulations required; they were softer. This could be an advantage, as softer balls might be easier to catch.\n",

The National Football League (NFL) commissioned an independent analysis. In this example, we will perform our own analysis of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pressure is often measured in pounds per square inch (psi). NFL rules stipulate that game balls must be inflated to have pressures in the range 12.5 psi and 13.5 psi. Each team plays with 12 balls. Teams have the responsibility of maintaining the pressure in their own footballs, but game officials inspect the balls. Before the start of the AFC game, all the Patriots' balls were at about 12.5 psi. Most of the Colts' balls were at about 13.0 psi. However, these pre-game data were not recorded.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the second quarter, the Colts intercepted a Patriots ball. On the sidelines, they measured the pressure of the ball and determined that it was below the 12.5 psi threshold. Promptly, they informed officials. \n",
