The *percent difference* between two values is used to compare values for which neither one is obviously `initial` or `changed`. For example, in 2014 Florida farms produced 2.72 billion eggs while Iowa farms produced 16.25 billion eggs (http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/). The percent difference is 100 times the absolute value of the difference between the values, divided by their average. In this case, the difference is larger than the average, and so the percent difference is greater than 100."

        "Learning how different functions behave is an important part of learning a programming language. A Jupyter notebook can assist in remembering the names and effects of different functions. When editing a code cell, press the *tab* key after typing the beginning of a name to bring up a list of ways to complete that name. For example, press *tab* after `math.` to see all of the functions available in the `math` module. Typing will narrow down the list of options. To learn more about a function, place a `?` after its name. For example, typing `math.log?` will bring up a description of the `log` function in the `math` module."
